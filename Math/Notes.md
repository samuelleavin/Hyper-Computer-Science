## Series

- Sum of `1..n`

    `= (n * (n + 1)) / 2 ~= n^2`

## Function definitions

- Log function:

  `log2(Q) = P` is defined as a function that reverses the exponetiation of `2^P = Q`

## Permutations and Combinations

### Permutations

- Order matters for permutations, e.g. lock combinations.
- `P` permutations of `n` things taken `r` at a time:

  `P(n, r) = nPr`

  `= n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)..(n - r + 1)`

  `= n! / (n - r)!`

### Combinations

- Order does not matter for Combinations, e.g. a handful of coins.
- `C` combinations of `n` things taken `r` at a time:

  `C(n, k) = nCr`

  `= (n \* (n-1) ... (n - k + 1))/(k(k - 1)) ... 1`

  `= n! / (k! * (n - k)!)`
